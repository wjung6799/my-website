The great physicist Richard Feynman once said, "The best way to verify your understanding of a concept is to try to explain it to someone with no expertise in that area."

This principle led to the development of the "Feynman Technique", a learning method that begins after reading or studying a topic. You start by pulling out a blank piece of paper and jotting down everything you remember about what you've learned, weaving it together in a comprehensible narrative. Initially, I was skeptical about this approach, but upon reflection, I realized that this type of learning is the foundation upon which software engineering is built.

Coding is a form of prose, and those who craft clear, understandable documentation add invaluable contributions to the field of software engineering. Inspired by this understanding, I decided to apply the Feynman Technique to my own learning journey and document it through this blog.

On this platform, I will share book summaries and insights from my learning each week. Through blogging, I aim to sharpen my writing skills, share my acquired knowledge, and chronicle my educational journey. I believe that through active engagement with these concepts, I can not only improve my understanding but also make a valuable contribution to others in the process.
